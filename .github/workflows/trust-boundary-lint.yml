Add one of these markers BEFORE the function:\n   - \`// server_trusted - Server-side business logic\`\n   - \`// client_private - Client-side crypto\`\n   - \`// e2ee_boundary - E2EE boundary (decrypt/encrypt)\`\n2. See docs: [Trust Boundaries](../../app/backend/crates/api/src/middleware/trust_boundary.rs)\n3. Re-push changes to re-run check\n\nFor questions, contact security team.`
